        To formally introduce myself, my name is Katrina Pan. I am currently a business student attending University of California, Riverside. Ever since my freshman year, I had a passion for business. The idea of working in a prominent corporation and having my own little cubicle is very appealing to me. This fire, this passion for business grew tremendously after taking many business courses, the FBLA Club and the career certification program. Since my sophomore year, I have been continuously attending business courses such as Accounting 1 and 2, as well as Marketing. Through my business courses, I obtained the knowledge of utilizing the Peachtree software, the accounting system for sole proprietorship, partnership and corporation, becoming a tremendous presenter, and much more. Furthermore, my time management improved, and I encountered unforgettable friends as well. 
        To further my experience of becoming a businesswoman, I partook in Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) as a member for one year and an officer for two years. I have won multiple awards such as placing in Top 10 for Accounting 1, Marketing, and Accounting 2 at Sectional Conference. Recently, I also placed in Top 10 in Accounting 2 at State Conference. In addition, I had the opportunity to view and experience the competitiveness of our society. Through these competitions, I learned how to study more effective and efficiently.
        <br><br>
        I am a passionate, hard-working, and punctual student striving for a better future in even an entry-level job. In groups, I usually play the role of the leader who schedules and plans everything. I split the work among everyone evenly by whichever part the group members would like to do, and I send reminders about the schedule to keep everyone on top of their own parts. Once the assignment/project is done (usually earlier than the due date), I proofread and give time for my group to give their opinions about each part. Then, I will do a final check (usually with the rubric) before one of the members or myself turns it in.
        Personally, my favorite part about working in groups is giving everyone a chance to talk and share their opinions/perspectives about the topic/overall project. I believe everyone should have a voice, and just because I am overseeing the project does not make me in any way above the other group members. I am only scheduling, planning, and proofreading because it is something, I am good at and that I like. My actions are only to organize the assignments/projects so it can be efficiently and effectively completed. 
        Outside of my professional work, I usually volunteer at my home church. We travel to local homeless shelters and provide various services from cleaning to passing out food. Furthermore, we travel to Ensenada, Mexico to hold evangelical outreaches and Vacation Bible School for the families and children in the high-poverty areas. On the last Thursday of every month, our church holds a food pantry in partnership with the LA Food Pantry to provide food for those who are struggling financially near our local church.
